 <h2 id="story" style="color: red;">The story you see on screen</h2>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">The "body" MV is a vibrant and confident showcase of Dayoung's new artistic identity. Gone is the bright, bubbly image often seen in WJSN's group activities. Instead, we are presented with a more mature, sleek, and stylish Dayoung. The music video is set in various striking locations, from a sleek, futuristic apartment to a dynamic dance stage. The use of saturated colors and sharp lighting enhances the bold, self-assured mood.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 The MV's narrative is less of a linear story and more of a mood-driven journey. It portrays Dayoung as a woman in control, not shying away from expressing her desires and confidence. The choreography is a central part of this narrative, with powerful and precise movements that complement the song's strong beat. The MV fluidly transitions between solo shots of Dayoung and scenes with backup dancers, showcasing her command of the stage.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 A key visual is the "rockstar" motif, which subtly appears through a confident gaze and fearless attitude, hinting at the B-side track "number one rockstar." This visual thread connects her solo work as a cohesive project, all about self-expression and owning her space in the music world.

 <h2 id="lyrics" style="color: red;">Lyrics &amp; meaning</h2>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">At first glance, the album title, <i>gonna love me, right?</i>, might seem like a question filled with a hint of insecurity. However, the lyrics of the title track "body" quickly reframe it as a confident challenge. This isn't a plea for love; it's a bold declaration of self-worth.
 </p>
 <div style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 <h3 style="color: blue;">Lyrical Story &amp; Narrative</h3>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">The song is a masterclass in using rhythm and repetition to build an undeniable sense of magnetism. The central refrain, "gonna love my body," isn't just about physical attraction. It's a powerful and direct embrace of self-love and authenticity. Dayoung's lyrics suggest that the most compelling form of love isn't something you seek from others, but something you confidently own within yourself. The line, "Tell me what you see in me, yeah," is not a question of doubt, but a playful dare—"Can you handle this much confidence?"
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 The lyrics also tell a story of breaking free from expectations. As a member of a group, an idol's image is often carefully curated. With her solo debut, Dayoung is singing about her real self, the artist she has become. The line "I'm a new type of story" perfectly captures this transition, inviting listeners to see her not just as "WJSN's Dayoung," but as the artist "Dayoung." It’s a message that resonates deeply with anyone who has ever tried to find their own voice.

 <h2 id="bts" style="color: red;">Behind the scenes &amp; member insights</h2>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">Dayoung's solo debut was a journey years in the making. She revealed she'd been actively preparing for this album for almost three years, with a level of dedication that surprised even her. This album was a true passion project, with Dayoung involved in every single creative decision—from planning and concept to lyrics and composition. Her fierce dedication was noted by major foreign media outlets.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 U.S. business magazine Forbes praised her for her "readiness for a pop rockstar era" and highlighted her insistence on conducting her interview in English, a clear sign of her global ambition. The U.K. music magazine NME described the album as a "bold, confident, and raw exploration of her true self."
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 The MV shoot was just as intense. Dayoung shared that the music video for "body" was largely filmed in a single take, a "confident challenge" to reveal her most authentic self. This creative choice required not only her rich ideas but also immense focus and teamwork on set. U.S. broadcaster FOX 13 Seattle also commented on her "rich ideas" and active involvement, stating she had "many ideas to make this work perfect for herself." This high level of personal input is what makes her solo debut resonate so deeply with fans and critics alike.
 </p>
 <p style="line-height: 1.7; margin: 0px 0px 12px;">
 Ultimately, this solo chapter isn't just about Dayoung’s music; it's a declaration of her artistic independence. As TMRW magazine so perfectly put it, "This solo debut is a self-declaration and an invitation for connection."
